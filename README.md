# AdvDupe2-Tools

Console commands to view, decode, and reencode (after changing) Advanced Duplicator 2 save files.

Based on upstream work of Advanced Duplicator 2 at https://github.com/wiremod/advdupe2

---

## Basic Usage

### Print (debug)

`ad2t_print "<name of dupe without .txt extension>"`: Prints the decoded dupe's table to console for viewing/debugging

### Decode (Write raw text to file)

`ad2t_decode "<name of dupe without .txt extension>"`: Decodes the given dupe file and saves the decoded dupe configuration and dupe info tables as JSON-formatted tables in .txt files in `GarrysMod\garrysmod\data\ad2t`

### Encode (Read raw text from decoded file and re-encode to AD2 format)

`ad2t_encode "<name of dupe without .txt extension>"`: Reads the decoded dupe configuration and dupe info files generated by ad2t_decode and reencodes and writes them into one `<dupe name>.txt` file in the same directory in which they were exported. This file can then be copied into `GarrysMod\garrysmod\data\advdupe2\` and loaded with the Advanced Duplicator 2 tool. 

`ad2t_encode` has two additional optional arguments, a new name for the dupe and whether to save the new dupe into the advdupe2 folder or not, with default values of the same name as the passed file and false. True/False cannot be passed unless a new name is also passed.

`ad2t_encode "<name of dupe without .txt extension" "<new name of dupe>"` 

or 

`ad2t_encode "<name of dupe without .txt extension" "<new name of dupe>" true`

This process is intended to allow one to decode a dupe, manually make changes to it (say, change a model to another similar model, then reload the changed file into with the normal AD2 stool.
