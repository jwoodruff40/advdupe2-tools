Console commands to view, decode, and reencode (after changing) Advanced Duplicator 2 save files.

Based on upstream work of Advanced Duplicator 2 at https://github.com/wiremod/advdupe2

---

## Basic Usage

`ad2t_print "<name of dupe without .txt extension>"`: Prints the decoded dupe's table to console for viewing/debugging

`ad2t_decode "<name of dupe without .txt extension>"`: Decodes the given dupe file and saves the decoded dupe configuration and dupe info tables as JSON-formatted tables in .txt files in `GarrysMod\garrysmod\data\ad2t`

`ad2t_encode "<name of dupe without .txt extension>"`: Reads the decoded dupe configuration and dupe info files generated by ad2t_decode and reencodes and writes them into one `<dupe name>.txt` file in the same directory in which they were exported. This file can then be copied into `GarrysMod\garrysmod\data\advdupe2\` and loaded with the Advanced Duplicator 2 tool. 

This process is intended to allow one to decode a dupe, manually make changes to it (say, change a model to another similar model, then reload the changed file into with the normal AD2 stool.
